# chatapp
This project is called universal chat. It is a open chat room that can be joined allowing you to connect with the world. The purpose of this project was to learn Vue js and Firebase, especially using Firebaseâ€™s real time updates. I built this project using the Vue CLI. I used the Vue router and different components to ensure the website had quick loading times. Each component template was built with HTML and then styled with Materialize and some CSS. I used route guarding and a login system to prevent users being able to access the chat room with signing in. This project also features styled timestamps, auto scrolling and live updates using Firestore. Go to https://ninja-chat-fa49e.firebaseapp.com/ and create a user name to test the chat room
